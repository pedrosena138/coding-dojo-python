# Coding Dojo - Pokedex

Create a Pokedex applying TDD

## What's Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is related with test-firs programming concepts of Extreme Programming (XP), begun in 1999. In 2003 Kent Beck "rediscovered" the method and created more public interest. The technique state that the test should be created before the code. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

## Pokedex

To become a Pokemon master we have to know everysingle pokemon, for this we are gonna create a Pokedex to save the Pokemons's info. We have to save and update these infos as we discovery new Pokemons, each Pokemon have these attributes

| attribute | description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|mc.;mvc.;xmv.mxc.;mv.;mzxc.;mv;zxcm;.vmz
| id        | int. id of the pokemon                |sdmvn,mcxn.,vn x, , m.xmvlkfsdjlçds
| name      | str. name of the pokemon              |fsdlkjfjhçlasdjffejlkfjçlfd
| height    | float. height of the pokemon          |cvnbc,xbnv,cxnbvb,mczx
| weight    | float. weight of the pokemon          |
| abilities | list. list of abilites of the pokemon |

Hint: We can use [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to check if the informations are correct

## Test

For execute tests cases we are using [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) library

## How to run?

```python -m unittest -v test```klbjfgbkljgfçljhgçkjghgfçjkdjghçlfdgkjm,.vnb,.nv,.bn.,cvnx,bvx
